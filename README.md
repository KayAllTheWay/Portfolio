# Portfolio
My portfolio

My portfolio is used to display some of the projects I have made, I used a Colorlib template to build it and linked it to my domain name. 
I added my own code to the template, for example the container that includes my 'project sections', I added bootstrap buttons to link my source code and the hosted projects from Github Pages and Heroku. I also added social media buttons and a brief 'about me' section that links my CV.
